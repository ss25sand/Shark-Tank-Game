# Shark-Tank-Game
Fun Python Game implemented using the Pygame Library

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Python 3 and Pygame must be installed. They can be installed as follows:

```
Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download Python 3.x
Visit https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads/ and click the installation link based on your operating system.
```

I understand there are other ways of installing python and pygame. Above is what I used.

### Installing

Clone or download the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ss25sand/Shark-Tank-Game.git
```

### Using

There are two parts to this project: <br/>
    1. Normal Keyboard Input --> SharkTankGame.py <br/>
    2. Button Circuit Input  --> SharTankGPIOGame.py <br/>

In order to use the second option, one must create a circuit using a raspberry pi following the schematics in Project_Info_Docs. For more information, explore Project_Info_Docs. Regardless, after deciding, run the python file of your choice.

### Game Play

As there is an integrated GUI, game play is self-explanatory, enjoy!
